Valerie's Database
---------------
Intended to store information regarding CLI commands and other generic coding information.

Since you didn't provide any arguments, here's how to use the database.

vdb -add entry_name: Add a new entry with the name entry_name.

vdb -mod entry_name: Modify the entry with the name entry_name.

vdb -list: Show a list in tree format of all the entries in the database.

vdb entry_name: Show the entry for name entry_name.

vdb: Show this page.


Choosing an Entry Name
----------------------
Entry names are to follow the following naming convention:
language/topic

So, for example, the entry on JUnit for Java would be named: java/junit.
That entry will show up in gdb -list as : java |
					       --> junit



Formatting Entries
------------------
Criteria:
- Entries must begin with the Gabe's Database title, immediately followed by a summary of the entry. For example, if the entry name is ffmpeg, this summary would describe the function of FFMPEG.
- Titles, Headings and Subheadings must be formatted with a line (-----) underneath it.
- The end of the entry must be marked with "-- END OF ENTRY --"
- Entries should have the date of last modification shown under the END OF ENTRY line. 



-- END OF ENTRY --
