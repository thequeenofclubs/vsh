Gabe's Manual
-------------

JUnit is a library in Java that is used to test portions of your code for runtime errors or to ensure output is as expected.

Usage
-----
Since JUnit is a library, you must import it via maven, or if the library is downloaded, you can import it directly with the import command.


JUnit.Assert()
--------------
There are many assertions that can be used to verify your code. Some of them are:

assertEquals(x,y): Checks if x and y are equal.
assertTrue(x): Checks if the boolean value x is true.
assertFalse(x): Checks if the boolean value x is false.
> Note: assertTrue() and assertFalse() can also be used with conditions, for example: assertTrue(x > y) will pass if x is greater than y.
